# Quebec Hystori

This was built using the Hystori React Calendar app here: [link](https://github.com/New-Humans/hystori)

This is a front-end calendar and codex for reading about and visualizing the events, people, and organizations that characterize the contemporary history of Quebec. It's a work in progress.

### Quebec: A Chronicle 1968-1972 | Publishing page

This is the copy I am citing, if ever for some reason a page number is referenced. A lot of the text is copied verbatim from this source, so I figure it's probably a good idea to really credit the dang thing.
